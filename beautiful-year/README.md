# Beautiful Year

It seems like the year of `2013` came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of `2013` is the first year after the old `1987` with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

## Input

The single line contains integer `y` (`1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000`) — the year number.

## Output

Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than `y` and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

## Examples

## input

```shell
1987
```

## output

```shell
2013
```

## input

```shell
2013
```

## output

```shell
2014
```
